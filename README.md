### Hey there 👋

Hello 👋
My name Mateus Aquino, I'm a brazilian Junior Data Scientist in love with Machine Learning and all sorts of statistical applications.

Originally in progress with a graduation in Statistics, and I believe in a better world led by science and also the "grammar of science" - which is statistics.
