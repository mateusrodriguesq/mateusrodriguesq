Hey there!
I'm Mateus Aquino, a passionate Data Scientist from Brazil, immersed in the fascinating world of Machine Learning and statistical applications. I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Statistics, where I'm developing a deep understanding of data analysis, probabilistic models, and the "grammar of science" that drives insights and innovations.

I believe that data, when coupled with rigorous scientific methodology, has the power to make the world a better place. My journey is fueled by a commitment to explore and apply data-driven solutions that are both impactful and reliable.

🔧 Technologies & Tools:

Programming: Python (main language), SQL
Data Engineering: Talend for ETL, Data Quality Assessment, and Validation
Machine Learning: Supervised and Unsupervised Learning, Predictive Modeling, Feature Engineering
Deep Learning: Neural Networks, NLP (Natural Language Processing), working with Large Language Models (LLMs)
ML Engineering: Model Deployment, MLOps principles, and scalability of ML solutions
🌟 Current Focus:
I'm particularly interested in creating, training, and optimizing Large Language Models (LLMs), with a goal of making these models more accurate and minimizing hallucinations. Additionally, I'm honing my skills in deploying ML models in production environments and exploring best practices in MLOps to ensure efficient workflows and robust model performance.
